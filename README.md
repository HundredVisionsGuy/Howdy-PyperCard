# Pypercard-Starter-Code
This is a little sample with some starter code to test out `pyscript` and the [`pypercard` module](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) using the code from **[Interactive Hello](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial3.html#interactive-hello)**

## Instructions
1. Click Use this template and name your copy of the repo whatever you like.
2. Open the project in VSCode by double-clicking `hello_pypercard.code-workspace` (or opening the project folder with your favorite editor)
3. You'll need to run this on a local server - I recommend installing the Live Server extension for VSCode, but you may have another way to do this.
4. Read the [PyperCard Tutorials](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) for specific details on what you can do.
5. Open `index.html` and examine the `<label>` and `<input>` tags in lines 19 and 20.
6. Bookmark and explore the options you have with various input types from W3School's **[HTML Input Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp)**
7. Watch my instructional video or begin exploring on your own ***STAY TUNED...***
